# Spotify Playlist Comparison Web App

I created this because I maintain a couple of larger playlists (500+ songs) on Spotify and make periodic backups of those playlists. I wanted an easy way to view the differences between the current and backed-up versions. 
There were a couple of sites out there that had some comparison features, but I didn't like how they approached it. This will be publically available, but I really just made it for my own personal use.
